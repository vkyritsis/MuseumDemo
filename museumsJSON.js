        Title: "Museum Herakleidon",
        Description: "The Museum Herakleidon has been bringing art, education, and culture to the general public since 2004. It aspires to help prepare young people, both intellectually and emotionally, to face the growing demands of our world, both today and tomorrow. The inspiration for this endeavor comes from the founders Paul and Anna-Belinda Firos. During the first decade of its operation (2004-2014), the museum focused on the fine arts (“Experience in Visual Arts”) and to this end organized exhibitions of the works of important artists (M.C. Escher, Victor Vasarely, Carol Wax, Constantine Xenakis, Adolf Luther, Francesco Scavullo, Toulouse-Lautrec, Edgar Degas, Edvard Munch, Sol LeWitt et al.). At the same time, a variety of cultural happenings (seminars, workshops, musical and literary events et al.) enabled visitors to experience directly the essence of the creators’ vision.Today the Museum Herakleidon has evolved into an interactive center for popularized science.Based on its philosophy of “Science, Art, and Mathematics”, it continues to provide original educational programs for students, teachers and adults at its main building (Herakleidon 16, Thissio), as well as exhibitions of art and popularized science at its annex (Ap.Pavlou 37, Thissio).In the framework of this philosophy, the new, permanent interactive exhibition ”I Play and Understand”, at the main building of the museum, invites children and adults to come into contact with science, art, and mathematics, through creative play with judiciously chosen and designed interactive exhibits.",

        Title: "National Observatory of Athens",
        Description: "The National Observatory of Athens is the first research Institution created in Greece (1842) after its liberation from the Ottoman (1828), the arrival of King Otto as the head of the modern Greek Kingdom (1833) and the establishment of Athens as the capital of the modern Greek state (1834). It followed the establishment of the two other oldest institutions of higher learning in the modern Greek state, the National Technical University of Athens (1836) and the University of Athens (1837)." +
            "The construction of the historic Sina's building on the hill of the Nymphs was financed by the Greek entrepreneur and national benefactor Georgios Sinas who was a successful banker in Vienna and ambassador of Greece to Austria. Sinas subsidized not only enterprises but states and royal families in Europe, financed the first permanent connection across the Danube between Buda and Pest, which is used even today and his name is inscribed on the base of the south western foundation of the bridge on the Buda side." +
            "The original Observatory building was designed by the renouned Danish Architect Theophilus Hansen, who also designed the Cathedral of Athens (1842) and two of the three contiguous buildings forming the so-called 'classical trilogy', namely the Academy of Athens and the National Library of Greece. The third building of the trilogy, the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, was designed by his brother Christian Hansen. Theophilus Hansen is considered an outstanding representative of neoclassicism. Besides his works in Athens, he is one of the most important and influential architects of the Viennese Ringstraße. His most famous work is the Austrian Parliament building, which was created in the style of an ancient, neo-classic temple, and serves to refer to the Greek beginnings of democracy. Hansen's famed Musikverein in Vienna is one of the most notable concert halls in the world; a concert hall whose design and acoustics are often admired and copied in present-day music houses." +
            "The hill of the Nymphs, selected as the place to build the Observatory, is one of the seven hills of Athens, a sanctuary of the Nymphs in antiquity. It is also next to the Pnyka hill where one of the early Observatories of the 5th century was located and where Meton’s Heliotropion was placed. The hill of the Nymphs is aligned with one of the most celebrated and best preserved meteorological/astronomical observatories, the Tower of the Winds, also the emblem of the Royal Meteorological Society. A rough copy of this Tower was built at the University of Oxford." +
            "The National Observatory of Athens facing the Parthenon and Thission is one of the landmarks of Athens; it has long been used by Greek and foreign Astronomers as the basis for astronomical, meteorological, chartographical and geodynamical measurements and observations in the more than 170 years long course of its history. Today the buildings of NOA at Thission include an Astrogeophysics Museum, housing clocks, telescopes and other instruments of the 19th century, as well as an extensive 19th century library. The activities of the National Observatory of Athens are organized in 3 research Institutes: the Institute of Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing, the Institute of Environmental Research and Sustainable Development, and the Geodynamics Institute. Besides basic and applied research and services to the society, these Institutes provide the facilities for graduate student training in collaboration with other Greek and foreign Universities. NOA hosts the UNESCO Chair for Natural Disasters and the Greek Focal Point of the Global Earth Observing System of Systems (GEOSS), operates the National Seismological Network, participates in the OPTICON and other international research networks, etc.",

Another fundamental aspect is the Foundation’s openness to joint projects and synergies with other institutions both within Greece and abroad, either through exchange activities, the building of network projects or co-productions" +

        Description: "Hellenic Motor Museum is situated in the city centre of Athens, in the heart of the city, in the uniquely designed building of the Capitol Mall cultural, leisure and commercial complex." +
            "The Museum covers 5.000 m2 of the complex in 3 whole floors, dedicated to technology and the 4 wheels evolution, a history that cover almost a century, from a 1895 fire engine from Hungary to a Ferrari 308 GTS." +
            "The museum, a highly-coveted private collection numbering more than 300 vehicles, is a childhood dream of Theodoros N. Charagionis, Executive Chairman of Charagionis Group. The founder’s vision was to document the history of the most cherished object the industrial revolution has produced, contributing to the field of road safety via educational screenings and lectures." +
            "Highlights in the collection include Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant's 1959 Chrysler Imperial, Formula 1 driver Lorenzo Bandini's personal 1953 Lancia Aurelia and the 1979 Cadillac Seville Gucci with its Gucci-designed interior and exterior fitments." +
            "Road safety programmes give to future drivers a basic knowledge combining play and education, while the more adventurous visitors have the opportunity to try their reflexes on a Formula 1 simulator!" +
            "Hellenic Motor Museum will also feature a conference centre with 200 seats capacity, a 3D cinema, the Museum Store, an eight-storey underground garage with 800 car park seats and a luxury resort style central square, with restaurants and coffee shops." +

            "Those cars bring to life different times and eras, when designing a car was almost a “national issue” and the English School had to confront the Italian feeling, the French charm, the German technology and the American concept of “big is beautiful”. Who can resist the charm of a 1931 PACKARD STANDARD EIGHT SEDANCA, the design of a 1934 BUGATTI TYPE 57 VENTOUX, the technology of a 1955 MERCEDES BENZ 300SL GULLWING, but also the “feeling” of a 1974 FERRARI 365 GT4 Berlinetta Boxer. Who can forget manufacturers with unique history such as AVION VOISIN, FACEL VEGA and also the legendary AUTO UNION, the predecessor of today’s AUDI!" +
            "During 2013-2014, the Museum will withdraw the current exhibits and will host approximately 100 racing cars and Formulas from the owner’s collection. In addition, two thematic exhibitions have been planned to take place within the current year; the first dedicated to the recently “lost” Italian designer Sergio Pininfarina and the second one to the “Greek” cars, namely cars designed by Greek designers or cars produced totally or partly in Greece." +
            "Our interactive program “Circulate with Safety” is addressed to all schools, public or private, in the area of Athens, as well as in all areas of Greece; it is a rather pioneering effort for our country, aiming to introduce to all children and young persons the basic principles of traffic education." +
            "Students of primary and high school, through their visit in the Hellenic Motor Museum, will have the opportunity to admire the unique exhibits of the Museum and afterwards and according to their age, participate in the Road Safety program at the 3rd floor." +
            "CHILDREN 6 – 12 YEARS OLD “Circulate with Safety” is an interactive game where children, during a “drive” in the city see the basic road traffic signs and learn how to react successfully in a busy traffic environment. Each child actively participates in a way that, while typically is participating in a game, he/she actually absorbs useful information that will be useful in everyday life, as soon as he/she leaves the Museum." +
            "The program is hosted in a special area and is organised in collaboration with 'Road Safety Institute Panos Mylonas'." +
            "A unique place for unforgettable events!" +
            "Hellenic Motor Museum offers high – tech alternative premises for hosting every type of corporate or social event. Each of three floors, has been designed in order to be transformed into an event hall and with the appropriate adjustments, to serve either corporate, scientific or sport events, or even wedding receptions, christenings’ gatherings or children’s parties." +
